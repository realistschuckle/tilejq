A ThemeRoller-ready tile view widget for jQuery UI that consumes HTML tiles.

## License

I have released this software under the BSD 3-clause license. Please see the
LICENSE file for details.

## Motivation

I wanted a tile view that did not rely on JavaScript arrays and special APIs.
Instead, I wanted a tile view that worked from an HTML collection of elements
that something else could manage, like [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com). I
could not find any and, so, tackling the problem like a programmer, spent a
couple of days putting one together.
